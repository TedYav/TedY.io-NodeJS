# Ted's Personal Website
## Powered by React Starter Kit

### Update

I have decided to retire this project. It was fun building React components and a full NodeJS webpage. However, hosting a NodeJS site for my personal page is not as cost effective as I'd like. Instead, I'm switching to a new solution using a client-side CMS that will be hosted on AWS S3 + Cloudfront.
